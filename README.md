### Inspiration

This project was developed while I attended Hackbright Academy for my capstone project.  Travelling is one of my favorite things to do and I am constantly planning trips for myself or other people.  I wanted to create a flexible application to track places to visit and potentially find new cool places I might have not found otherwise.  Another goal was to really dive into different tools and technologies while making this project.
